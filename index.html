    <script src="script.js"></script>

    <p>i grew up in a creative household -- we read books, painted, wrote music. my dad has an MFA in creative writing and a BA in poetry and philosophy. my mom has an MA in education and a BA in fashion design. i've always been a creative person, not a technical one -- i didn't necessarily 'excel' in my STEM courses in high school, although i was in the honors and advanced course selections for each subject.</p>
